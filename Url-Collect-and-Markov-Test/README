# Abstraction
A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. This project collected the random webiste and uesd the 2-grams model to obtain the high frequency vocabulary. An n-gram model is a type of probabilistic language model for predicting the next item in such a sequence in the form of a (n âˆ’ 1)-order Markov model. Both n-gram model and morkov chain model are uesful in NLP(natural language processing). This project choosed the highest frequecy vocabulary that occurred in the 2-grams model to take the markov test.
